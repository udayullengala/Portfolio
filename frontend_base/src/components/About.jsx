              I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with expertise in modern web technologies. Currently working at
              redchillies.vfx, I specialize in building scalable web applications using React, Next.js, Python, and
              Django. I enjoy solving complex problems and creating seamless user experiences that bridge the gap
              between beautiful design and robust functionality. My journey in web development has taken me from
              frontend specialization to full-stack mastery, allowing me to deliver complete solutions from concept to
              deployment.
